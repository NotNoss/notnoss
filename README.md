## I am a college student, IT Professional and Developer
I am still fairly new to programming but I am having a lot of fun.

Most of my projects, you will not be able to find because they were purged or not uploaded.

- I am currently working on re-writing my bot for my [Discord server](http://discord.itsnoss.tech)
